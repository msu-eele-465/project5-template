# General Development Process 

- Do your initial planning activities in a `planning` branch.
    - Plan out your software architecture.
    - Complete the workload distribution form.
    - Write pseudocode or create flowcharts for the main components.
    - Create a preliminary circuit diagram.
- Once your initial planning is done, create a pull request for the `planning` branch.
- For each module or feature (e.g., keypad, RGB LED, pwm, LCD, etc.):
    - Create a new branch.
    - Do any initial planning (e.g., pseudocode, flowcharts, diagrams) that wasn't done earlier. Do this and commit this before writing code.
    - Implement and test the module. Use separate test files to test the module (i.e., don't test everything in the main app; using separate test files lets you easily re-run tests to verify nothing broke or the module still works).
    - Create a pull request. The pull request must include evidence of your module working (e.g., screenshots from the AD2 showing that your code works, or some other form of validation).
    - Have your team member(s) perform a code review.
    - Once your team member(s) have approved the pull request, merge it into `main`.


We're following a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
The git history will look something like this:

```mermaid
gitGraph:
    commit
    branch planning
    switch planning
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge planning
    branch pwm
    switch pwm
    branch keypad
    switch keypad
    commit
    commit
    switch pwm
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch keypad
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge keypad
    switch pwm
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge pwm
    branch rgb
    switch rgb
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge rgb
    branch integration
    switch integration
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge integration
    branch final-docs
    switch final-docs
    commit
    commit
    commit
    switch main
    merge final-docs
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No development should happen in the `main` branch. Everything should be done in a separate branch and be review/approved by the team via pull requests. When you're working together on integration, this should still be done in a separate branch.

> [!TIP]
> Remember to use `--set-upstream origin <branch-name>` when pushing your new branch for the first time.
> ```
> git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
> ```


## Git Resources

Please refer to any of the git resources I've put on Brightspace or linked in the [intro to git presentation](https://msu-eele-465.github.io/intro-to-git/). There are so many git resources, tutorials, and videos out there; I'm sure you'll find something that helps and makes sense for you.
