# Demo grading rubric

Points are based upon the points you assigned in the workload distribution form. Your points grade for each criterion/requirement/specification will be a percentage of the points you assigned on the workload distribution form.

For extra credit items, points are given to both partners.

## Presentation

The following table describes the levels that can be achieved for the presentation-specific grades.

## Requirements and specifications

The achievement levels for requirements and specifications are the same for each req/spec. The table below shows the generic levels. Extra credit reqs/specs either work or don't work---no in-between.

<table><thead>

    <th>Req/spec type</th>
    <th colspan="2">Did not perform</th>
    <th colspan="2">Underperformed</th>
    <th colspan="2">Met expectations</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Required</td>
    <td>Spec was not met at all</td>
    <td>0.00%</td>
    <td>Spec was mostly met, but not convincingly demonstrated</td>
    <td>50.00%</td>
    <td>Spec was met and was convincingly demonstrated</td>
    <td>100.00%</td>
