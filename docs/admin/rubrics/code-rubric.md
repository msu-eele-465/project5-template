    <td>0.5</td>

    <td><b>Code modularity and organization</b></td>
    <td>0.5</td>
    <td>Code is poorly organized and not modular. Everything is in one file.</td>
    <td >0</td>
    <td>Code is somewhat organized, but the organization could be clearer or more consistent. Code is somewhat modular, but some modules do multiple unrelated things (i.e., they don't have a single responsibility)</td>
    <td>0.25</td>
    <td>Code organization is clear. Code is split into modules that have a clear single purpose. Modules are loosely coupled to other modules and can easily be reused.</td>
